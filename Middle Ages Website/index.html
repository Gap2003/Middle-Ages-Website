    <h2 id="pt1">What Were The Middle Ages?</h2>
    <p>
        The Middle Ages, also known as the Dark Ages began with the fall of the Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages was the middle period of three divisions of western history beginning with Classical Antiquity and ending with the Modern Period. The middle ages were subdivided into the Early Middle Ages, the High Middle Ages, and the Late Middle Ages.
    </p>
    <h3>The Early Middle ages</h3>
    <p>
        Population decline, counterurbanisation (people moving from urban areas to rural areas), invasions and movement of peoples, which had begun in the Late Antiquity period continued in the Early Middle Ages. Large movements of people from the Migration period established new kingdoms out of what was left of the Roman Empire. During this time, many empires expanded their territory and began to establish political structures.
    </p>
    <h3>The High Middle Ages</h3>
    <p>
        The population of Europe started to increase greatly because of technological and agricultural innovations. This was also the time of the Medieval Warm Period, a time when temperatures increased, leading to increased crop yield.
        During the High Middle Ages, Two ways society was organised emerged, these are: <br>
        Manorialism:  the organisation of peasants into villages that owed rent and labour services to the nobles <br>
        Feudalism: the political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords in return for the right to rent from lands and manors <br>
        Around 1095 the crusades started, they were military attempts to retake the Holy Land from the muslims. Kings started to become the heads of nation-states, reducing crime and violence but they made the idea of a unified Christendom less of a reality. Scholasticism became a popular philosophy. Scholasticism emphasises on joining faith with reason and resulted in the founding of universities. There were some outstanding achievements near the end of the High Middle Ages including the travels of Marco Polo.

        
    </p>
    <h3>The Late Middle Ages</h3>
    <p>
        The Late Middle Ages were marked by tragedies such as famine, plague and war, significantly diminishing the population of Europe. Between 1347 and 1350, the Black Death killed about a third of Europeans. Controversy, heresy, and the Western Schism within the Church paralleled interstate conflicts such as civil strife, and peasants revolts. In the end, Cultural and technological advancements transformed European society and marking the beginning of the early modern period.

<div class="pt2">
   <h2 id="pt2">What Happened to The Church?</h2>
   <p> 
       Roman Catholic was the supreme power and the only accepted church. They stabilized forces in life and leadership and dominated people’s lives. People started to drift from the word of God and rely on the pope for salvation. The Bible almost disappeared and people became spiritually exhausted, almost lifeless and engrossed in real heresy.
    </p>
   <h3 class="Beliefs">Beliefs</h3>
   <p>
    Some of the beliefs of the Roman Catholic church were:
   </p>
   <h3>Infallibility of the pope</h3>
   <p>The church said the pope was God’s representative and could do no wrong</p>
   <h3>Salvation in the Roman Catholic church only.</h3>
   <p> They believed people would go to hell if they did not accept the pope as God’s representative and the Catholic church as the one true church. Excommunication from the church meant your soul was lost.</p>
   <h3>Salvation by works</h3>
   <p>They thought you were not saved by God’s grace, but by the practices of the Catholic church. They said you were saved by works prescribed by the church. Having faith meant submission to the church.</p>
   <h3>Worshipping of saints</h3>
   <p>More people practiced good works to become more “saint like.” This supposedly brought them closer to heaven. They worshipped the “most holy” pope and believed the saints were like mediators between man and God</p>
</div>
<!-- Third Part -->
<div class="pt3">
    <h2 id="pt3">How Did It Deform In Doctrine And Life?</h2>
    <p>
        Instead of following God and the Bible, they followed the church and all of its doctrines on salvation. The Bible says that salvation is only through Christ, but the Roman Catholic Church said that you can only obtain salvation through good works. The church totally disregarded the bible and turned to the belief of obtaining everything through good works.

    </p>
    <h3>Doctrine</h3>
<p>
    Instead of the doctrine believing salvation only through Christ, the doctrine became 
    salvation through good works. The Roman church believed salvation in the Roman 
     Church only, worshiping of saints and many others. They believed that you can only go to heaven if the church sees that you have done good enough good works.

</p>
    <h3>Life</h3>
<p>
    Instead of doing everything for the glory of God, the people started to do everything to 
    man’s glory. They started to try to do good works in “order to earn their way to heaven.” 
    The people practiced the system of penance and the system of indulgence. The system 
    of penance was a system that people had to confess all of their sins to the church to 
    prove the reality of their faith. Instead of looking to Christ for forgiveness, the people had 
    to look to the church for forgiveness through the practice of “good works.” The system of 
    indulgence was a system of exchange where the Pope granted a temporal punishment 
    in purgatory on a person due to their sins that weren’t “paid for.” So, the priests would do priestly services, such as praying, fasting and reading the scriptures for a person. It’s basically, you can buy your own forgiveness of sins.

    <h2 id="pt4">What Positives Were There?</h2>
    <p>
Some benefits of the Middle Ages include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Education</li>
        <li>Hospitals</li>
        <li>Improved Economy</li>
        <li>Technological Development</li>
        <li>Care For The Poor</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>
    The Middle Ages were a time of exceeding development in education. In 1079, Pope Gregory VII declared that the church would build cathedral schools, institutes designed to educate people to one day become members of the clergy. The success of cathedral schools led to the development of universities in the 12th century. These universities soon began to teach medicine and law instead of just religious training. The growing popularity of universities meant that more people were required to learn Latin because Latin was mandatory in university education. Because of the need of people to speak Latin, the church designed primary education facilities in order to prepare men to go to university. Through the creation of these universities and primary education institutions, the Catholic Church spread literacy and promoted the growth of intellectual curiosity.
</p>
<h3>Hospitals</h3>
<p>
    Until universities started to house medical facilities, most medical care occurred in Catholic monasteries. The Church went on to found the university system, providing real medical care and trained physicians. The church was also responsible for creating the European hospital system that began in the 13th century when Pope Innocent III ordered the construction of a hospital in the city of Rome. The hospital became so popular, it caused hundreds more to be constructed across Europe following the same model as the one in Rome. Because of hospitals, medical care became accessible for nearly all of Europe for the first time in history.
</p>
<h3>Improved Economy</h3>
<p>
    In 1095, Pope Urban II convinced Europeans to declare war on the middle east in order to recapture Jerusalem from the muslims. This began a series of Crusades lasting until the 13th century. The Crusades were generally unsuccessful but they led to vast economic change in Europe. Crusades were very expensive and required rich Europeans to spend a lot of money. In order to fund a crusade, churches and noblemen sold property and took loans. They also paid lower class people for services. All of this majorly redistributed European wealth. While the Crusades were happening, new trade routes through the Middle East and the creation of guilds and modern lending institutes lede to more modern economies and formation of the middle class.
</p>
<h3>Care For The Poor</h3>
<p>
    As the Crusades began and commerce started to develop in Europe, two new classes of people emerged in European society: the middle class, and the extremely poor. The extremely poor were often reduced to begging on the streets so governments attempted to ban them from public areas. Governments also put vagrancy laws in place to keep beggars out of cities. In response to the hatred of the poor, the Church began to protect them. The Church insisted the poor had basic human rights and exempted them from court fees in Ecclesiastical courts. The Church also provided free legal counsel, food, shelter and alms to the poor.
</p>
<h3>Technological Development</h3>
<p>
    After the fall of the Roman Empire, there was sudden development of windmills and watermills in Europe. During this time, a new era of technological development came. Each new technology that was discovered freed more Europeans from excessive labour. Technological development in Europe included equipment such as: better harnesses, ploughs, mills, sailing technology, and more. A positive of all of this technological development was that it encouraged some Europeans to travel far distances. The technology slowly improved during the history of Europe.
